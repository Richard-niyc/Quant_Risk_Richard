# Data Processing and Visualization

## Overview
This project retrieves Bitcoin (BTC) options data from Deribit, extracts implied volatilities, and visualizes the implied volatility surface using a 3D graph. The results are saved for future reference, and the entire process can be automated with minimal manual intervention.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- The following Python packages are required:
  - `requests`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`

The following Python packages are required:
```sh
pip install requests matplotlib numpy scipy
```

## Running the Project
1. **Clone the repository**

   Clone the project repository from GitHub or download the source code manually:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
3. **Run the script**

## Functions
- **`get_instruments(currency="BTC", kind="option")`**: Fetches all BTC option instruments from the Deribit API.
- **`get_order_book(instrument_name)`**: Retrieves the order book for a specific instrument to obtain its implied volatility.
- **`get_implied_volatilities(instruments)`**: Iterates over all instruments to fetch their implied volatilities and calculates the time to expiration.
- **`visualize_iv_surface(iv_data)`**: Visualizes the implied volatility surface using a 3D plot, including a smoothed version of the surface using a Gaussian filter.
- **`main()`**: Orchestrates the workflowâ€”fetching instruments, retrieving implied volatilities, saving data to a JSON file, and visualizing the implied volatility surface.

## Detailed Steps
### 1. Fetching Instruments
The `get_instruments` function fetches all available BTC option instruments from the Deribit API.

### 2. Getting Implied Volatilities
The `get_implied_volatilities` function calculates the implied volatility for each instrument along with the time to expiration in milliseconds.

### 3. Visualizing the Implied Volatility Surface
The `visualize_iv_surface` function generates a 3D plot of the implied volatility surface. It produces both the original and smoothed surfaces using a Gaussian filter.

### 4. Saving the Results
The script saves the implied volatility data and graphs locally for future reference.

## Output
The script generates the following 3D plots:
- **Original Mark Implied Volatility Surface**
- **Smoothed Mark Implied Volatility Surface**

## Automating Daily Runs
To run the script daily with minimal manual intervention:
- **Unix-based systems**: Set up a cron job.
- **Windows systems**: Use Task Scheduler.
